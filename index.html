                        <li><span>Summary</span><br>I am a motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science and Data Science student with a strong foundation in programming, backend development, and data analytics. Through my studies and experiences, I hve gained experience in Python, Java, SQL, and Django, with hands-on contributions to real-world projects involving automation, database optimization, and full-stack development. I am currently seeking an internship opportunity to apply technical expertise in software engineering, data science, or machine learning to impactful projects.<br></li>
                        <li><span>My Life</span><br>
                            My journey began when I was four years old when my parents made the bold decision to leave Israel for America. Though young, this transition profoundly shaped my worldview and aspirations. I grew up witnessing their unwavering determination as they built a life from scratch, driven by the promise of the "American Dream". Nearly two decades later, their resilience paid off. They not only established themselves but flourished, creating opportunities for my siblings and I that far exceeded their own upbringing. This early exposure to perseverance and hard work became the cornerstone of my approach to life and career.
                            <br><br>I've channeled this work ethic into my professional endeavors, most notably during my time at V-Armed, a virtual reality combat simulation company, and in various personal projects. While my computer and data science studies often involve long hours in front of screens, I maintain balance through my passion for sports. Basketball is my first love, but I also enjoy football, tennis, volleyball, and soccer. Beyond sports, I also enjoy reading and writing, as they have become vital moments of relaxation, offering a much-needed reset for both mind and body.
                            <br><br>My early immersion in American culture, combined with the values instilled by my immigrant parents, has given me a unique perspective. It's this blend of experiences that has shaped me into the driven individual I am today. As I continue my journey in tech, I carry with me the lessons of my parents' courage and an unwavering commitment to personal growth and professional excellence.</p>

                            <b>Freelance Backend Developer (Winter 2024 - Present)</b><br>I collaborated on an ongoing GitHub-hosted project, leveraging Git for version control to maintain organized Python code versions and streamline teamwork through efficient code reviews and pull requests. My contributions included designing and implementing a Google Sheets automation tool using Python, Django, and the Google Sheets API, enabling real-time data updates, user-specific formatting, and enhanced reporting accuracy. Additionally, I optimized database query performance by refining Django ORM filters, joins, and related field lookups, significantly reducing query times and improving efficiency in handling large datasets.<br><br>
                            <span>V-Armed</span><br>
                            <b>Development Intern (Summer 2024)</b><br>During the summer of 2024, I collaborated with a team of developers at V-Armed's Brooklyn studio to create and enhance combat-simulation virtual reality projects. My role involved leveraging C++ to debug and optimize existing code in Visual Studio, as I developed custom features and enhanced pre-existing ones for improved efficiency and functionality. Additionally, I created and implemented features using Unreal Engine Blueprints, including a customizable 3D text rendering system with adjustable color, spacing, and depth. I also continued to assist in user testing and maintenance as a follow-up for my time here last summer.<br><br>
                            <b>Summer Intern (Summer 2023)</b><br>In the summer of 2023, I served as a summer intern at V-Armed, focusing on the calibration and maintenance of state-of-the-art VR technology. My responsibilities included handling and testing of headsets, sensors, cameras, and miscellaneous accessories to ensure optimal performance for clients such as the NYPD. Additionally, I supported administrative tasks, maintained the large studio space, and assisted with special projects. This experience allowed me to gain familiarity with company operations and contribute to a collaborative work environment.<br>
